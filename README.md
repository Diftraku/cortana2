# cortana2
Spiritual successor to Mursu's Intel Galileo based Cortana IRC-bot.

## What is this about?
Cortana was originally the IRC-bot used for announcing the status of the OtaHOAS clubroom at JMT11CD.

Due to the extensive renovation, JMT11CD clubroom was off-limits for an extended period of time, during which the Intel Galileo board used for running the original IRC-bot went missing/kaput. There has been a collective effort to bring back the IRC-bot but the closest to a working bot had been a metal case with a switch.

This project is an effort to prot the Python 2 version of the Sopel modules to Python 3 and a newer version of Sopel.

## Credits
All original code belongs to Mursu and is available at https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/sinkkov1/cortana-sopel/tree/master (checked on 22.10.2019).
Cortana is a character from the Halo -series of games made by Bungie and 343 Studios.

## Development and Usage
The contents of this repository are mainly for reference purposes and actually running the bot.

No effort is made to make this code portable across different platforms other than this is intended to run on.

Sopel is running in a virtualenv on the Raspberry Pi located in the clubroom.
