# cortana2
Spiritual successor to Mursu's Intel Galileo based Cortana IRC-bot.

## What is this about?
Cortana was originally the IRC-bot used for announcing the status of the OtaHOAS clubroom at JMT11CD.

Due to the extensive renovation, JMT11CD clubroom was off-limits for an extended period of time, during which the Intel Galileo board used for running the original IRC-bot went missing/kaput. There has been a collective effort to bring back the IRC-bot but the closest to a working bot had been a metal case with a switch.

This project is an effort to prot the Python 2 version of the Sopel modules to Python 3 and a newer version of Sopel.
